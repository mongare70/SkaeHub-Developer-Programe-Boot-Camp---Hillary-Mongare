# Explanation on 'numpy_today_yesterday_tomorrow'
    This is a program that prints out the dates:
        * Today
        * Yesterday
        * Tomorrow
    
    The program uses the NumPy library and gets the 'today' date by using 
    the datetime64 method in the NumPy library.
    The 'yesterday' date is got by subtracting 1 from the 'today' date.
    The 'tomorrow' date is got by adding 1 to the 'today' date.
